# = PathFinder::Mysql:Query
#
# Concrete subclass of PathFinder::Query
#
# == Usage:
#
# This class generates the SQL and makes the call to find_by_sql.
# It is called from find_by_path in PathFinder::FindByPath. Look there
# for an example how to use it.
#
# == Resolving Permissions
#
# It uses a fulltext index on page_terms in order to resolve permissions for pages.
# This bypasses potentially really hairy four-way joins on user_participations
# and group_participations tables.
# (not to mention a potential 5th,6th,7th joins for tags, ugh!)
#
# An example query:
#
#  SELECT * FROM pages
#  JOIN page_terms ON pages.id = page_terms.page_id
#  WHERE
#    MATCH(page_terms.access_ids)
#    AGAINST('+(0001 0011 0081 0082) +0081' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
#
# * this is an inner join, because *every* page should
#   have a corresponding page_term.
# * page_term.access_ids is a text column with a fulltext index.
# * the format of the values in access_ids is thus:
#   * user ids are prefixed with 1
#   * group ids are prefixed with 8
#   * every id is at least four characters in length,
#     padded with zeros if necessary.
#   * if page is public, id 0001 is present.
#
# So, suppose the current user was id 1, and they were
# members of groups 1 and 2.
#
# To find all the pages of group 1 that current_user may access:
#
#    (current_user.id OR public OR current_user.all_group_ids) AND group.id
#
# In fulltext boolean mode search on access_ids, this becomes:
#
#    +(0011 0001 0081 0082) +0081
#
# The first part of this condition is called the access_me_clause. This is where we
# resolve the question "what does current user have access to?". This clause is
# based entirely on the current_user variable.
#
# The next AND clause is called the access_target_clause. This is where we ask "who's
# pages are we searching for?". This clause is based entirely on what options
# are used (ie options_for_group() or options_for_user())
#
# There can be additional AND clauses. These are called access_filter_clauses.
# This is for additional limits that pop up in the path itself. It is based
# entirely on what is in the filter path.
