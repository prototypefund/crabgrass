Install for development
====================================================

For installation using Vagrant, see [doc/development/vagrant.md](development/vagrant.md).

### Install basic ruby environment
(Tested with ruby 2.1, at least ruby 2.0)

#### Debian-based system

    sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev rake mysql-server mysql-client
    libmysqld-dev git make libssl-dev g++ sphinxsearch graphicsmagick

##### Debian stable

On Debian stable 9, mysql has been replaced by MariaDB. To set up the environment, we need to replace libmysql-dev by libmariadb-dev.

    sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev rake mysql-server mysql-client
    libmariadb-dev git make libssl-dev g++ sphinxsearch graphicsmagick

Depending on what you are running, you might need to install `git-core`
instead of `git`. You might also need libopenssl-ruby.
If installing using bundler, you may need `libmysqlclient-dev` and `libsqlite3-dev`.

#### Redhat-based system

    yum install ruby ruby-devel rubygem-rake mysql-server mysql-devel git gcc make
    ImageMagick

#### OSX system

This install will assume you are using a Ruby versioning tool such as [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/). These tools are by no means OSX dependent. You can replace .zshrc with .bash_profile if you use bash.

If you don't have git:

	brew install git
Once you have git:

	git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
	echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
	echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
	git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
	source ~/.zshrc
	rbenv versions

Once you have the code, run this from inside of the source directory. Ruby 2.1.5 should work here, but you can customize it if need be.

	rbenv install 2.1.5
	gem install bundler
Now for the app dependencies

	brew install mysql graphicsmagick sphinx --with-mysql

To run MySQL

	mysqld

If you run into any problems bundling with bundle install (a few steps down), make sure that you are up to date with XCode and that you have installed the command line developer tools.  XCode can be updated from the App Store. You may need to open XCode after updating to accept the licenses. If you need the command line tools, run the following.

	xcode-select --install

### Checkout the codebase

    git clone ssh://git@0xacab.org:riseuplabs/crabgrass.git
    or
    git clone https://0xacab.org/riseuplabs/crabgrass.git

Alternately, do a shallow clone. This will only check out a copy of the most recent version.

    git clone --depth 1 https://0xacab.org/riseuplabs/crabgrass.git

### Install bundler

If you don't yet have bundler, install it now as root.

    sudo gem install bundler

Alternatively you can install bundler with your package manager.

### Install rails and required gems

    cd crabgrass
    bundle install

### Create the database

This will also set up your test database. Prior to running the `rake db:create` command, you will need to set up the `crabgrass_development` and `crabgrass_test` databases and configure them in the database.yml file according to your mysql or mariadb set up. In addition, I needed	 to set up my databases with mariadb with `utf8` encoding. [See here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11644804/rails-creating-schema-migrations-mysql2error-specified-key-was-too-long#13143985)

    cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
    rake db:create
    rake db:schema:load
    rake cg:convert_to_unicode
    rake db:fixtures:load

### Run the server

    BOOST=1 bundle exec rails server

Connect to the web application from your browser:

    http://localhost:3000
    login: blue
    password: blue

The first request will be slow because the server compiles the stylesheets  for the themes.
See doc/development/* for more notes on development.

Install for testing
====================================================

### Install additional gems needed for testing

    sudo RAILS_ENV=test bundle install

### Create testing database

If you haven't run rake db:create already.

    sudo mysqladmin create crabgrass_test
    cd crabgrass
    rake db:test:prepare

### Run tests:

    bundle exec rake

Install for production
====================================================

setup the environment
---------------------

Many of the following commands require RAILS_ENV to be set. You can do so
for the current session with
    export RAILS_ENV=production

You may also want to add this to your shell environment by default.

Alternatively you can prefix the commands involving rails or rake like this

    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails c

install prerequisites
----------------------

Download and install ruby, rubygems, rails, and mysql the same way as
in the 'install for development' instructions.

Then:

    apt-get install sphinxsearch
    bundle install

`sphinxsearch` is not technically required, but crabgrass runs 100 times faster
with it installed.

setup the database
----------------------

create the database:

    sudo mysqladmin create crabgrass

create database.yml:

    cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml

edit config/database.yml:

    username: crabgrass
    password: your_password

set the permissions:

    > mysql --user root -p
    mysql> use crabgrass;
    mysql> grant all on crabgrass.* to crabgrass@localhost identified by 'your_password';
    mysql> flush privileges;
    mysql> quit

initialize the database:

    rake cg:convert_to_unicode
    rake db:schema:load

A note about unicode support: running `rake db:create` does not correctly create a
fully unicode compatible database. To make non-latin languages work, you need the
`rake cg:convert_to_unicode` task. It only needs to be run once, but is
non-destructive, so it can be run anytime.

compile assets
-----------------------

We use the rails assets pipeline for compiling javascript. In order to do so
this should be run after deploying a new version of the codebase:

    rake assets:precompile

See the asset pipeline docs for more information and alternative strategies:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#precompiling-assets

For css we rely on our custom theming mechanism. In order to install the css
files for images please run

    rake cg:images:update_css

configure apache
-----------------------

See doc/deployment/apache for information on deploying for production with apache.

set up crontab
-----------------------

There are a bunch of maintenance tasks that need to be updated regularly. The
easiest way to do this is to set up a crontab. The gem `whatever` will install
one for you from the schedule.rb config file.

    whenever --update-crontab -f config/misc/schedule.rb

start delayed job daemon
--------------------

We index updated documents in sphinx using delayed job.
(ts-delayed-delta to be exact).
Run delayed job as a daemon so it can start the jobs:

    script/delayed_job start

You may want to symlink script/delayed_job from your start script directory
such as /etc/init.d

Configuration options
====================================================

All the options that you might want to change live in three places:

1. config/database.yml
2. config/secret.txt
3. config/crabgrass/crabgrass-<mode>.yml.

See config/crabgrass/README for more information.
