Javascripts
==============================================

Javascript are served using the Sprockets gem for asset pipelining.
We load all scripts by including application.js on all pages.

About these scripts
----------------------------------------------

app/javascripts/libraries/history.js

  A library to make HTML5 window.history work better, and also fallback
  gracefully for HTML4 browsers. It is a little heavyweight, and includes
  a bunch of features we don't need -- like storing data with history.

app/javascripts/prototype.js

  core additions to javascript. included in prototype directory are the
  scriptaculous effects for prototype that we also use.


Stylesheets
==============================================

Most stylesheets are in app/stylesheets and are generated different
for each theme.

However, stylesheets in app/assets/stylesheets will be compiled and
will use the normal rails asset pipeline.
