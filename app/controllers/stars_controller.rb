#
# StarsController
#
# Add and remove stars from posts and maybe other things in the future.
#
# We rely on the stars_count counter cache in the starred object. So please
# stick to functions based on the association such as
#   @starred.stars.create
# to make sure the counter_cache of the associated object is updated.
#
# We redirect to the starred object (post) which will rerender it on
# the page.
# This way we can ignore all error cases because the current state will be
# rendered to the view either way. So if a post already was starred and
# a user tries to star it again it will just see the starred post when the
# request returns - no need for an error message.
#
# The redirect also means that page reloads work nicely. They do not trigger
# the starring again. In the long run it may also allow us to benefit from
# turbo links as turbo links handles GET requests only - which include GETs as
# a result of redirects.
