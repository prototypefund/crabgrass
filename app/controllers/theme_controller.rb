#
# Our CSS is dynamically generated and then statically cached. There are a
# couple ways we could do this: one would be to generate the CSS files when
# the urls are referenced in the html header (ie <stylesheet ... />)
#
# Another method would be to make the stylesheet urls hit a controller, and
# have that controller re-render the stylesheets. This is what we have done
# here. I am not sure which method is better, but this seems to work.
#
# This does not work, however, for destroying the cache. For this, we do
# use the first method: Theme.stylesheet_url(..) will destroy the cached
# sheets in development mode if they need to be re-rendered. It might
# make more sense to combine both the rendering and the destroying in the
# same place. One advantage of the method here is that we can display
# a nice stylesheet specific error message if there is a sass syntax error.
