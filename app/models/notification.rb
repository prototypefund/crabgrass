# A notification informs users about an action that just took place.
#
# The users may be notified by different means - email, notice, etc.
# For now this will be hardcoded but it may be configurable for users at
# some point.
#
# For each thing that happens one Notification instance will inform
# all the recipients and may create many emails or notices.
