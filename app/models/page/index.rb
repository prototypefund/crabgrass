# FULLTEXT SEARCHING and PERMISSIONS
#
# Here in lies the code for supporting full text indexing of pages, to be
# used by sphinx and mysql fulltext index. See crabgrass_plugins/crabgrass_path_finder for how this is actually searched.

module Page::Index
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_one :page_terms,

  module ClassMethods
    # returns the an array of group and user ids, but transformed.
    # this transformation is neccessary for sphinx (so that group ids
    # and user ids are in the same attribute) and for mysql fulltext
    # (where terms must be at least 4 characters long).
    #
    # When stored in sphinx, these are converted to numbers. When stored
    # in mysql, these are stored as strings.
    #
    # for example:
    #   access_ids_for(:public => true, :group_ids => [1,2,3000], :user_ids => [4,5,6000])
    # returns:
    #   ["0001", "0081", "0082", "83000", "0014", "0015", "16000"]
    #
    # The rules:
    #
    #  * pad with 0 to at least 4 chars.
    #  * prefix user ids with 1
    #  * prefix group ids with 8
    #  * 0001 means the page is marked public.
    #
    def access_ids_for(args = {})
      id_array = []
      id_array += ['0001'] if args[:public]
      id_array += args[:group_ids].collect { |id| encode_group_id(id) } if args[:group_ids]
      id_array += args[:user_ids].collect  { |id| encode_user_id(id) } if args[:user_ids]
      id_array
    end

    def encode_user_id(id)
      format('%04d', "1#{id}")
    end

    def encode_group_id(id)
      format('%04d', "8#{id}")
    end

    # converts a tag list array into a tag list array suitable for searching a
    # fulltext index.
    #
    # The rules:
    #
    #  * The tag must be CGI url escaped so that special characters are not in the
    #    fulltext index. The fulltext matching does not work on characters like
    #    !@#$%^&()=*.
    #  * space, '+', and '.' are not allowed, we replace with '_'. (The +
    #    character is not allowed since this is how CGI.escape encodes spaces).
    #  * The character % is not allowed, so we replace it with 'QQ'. This is not
    #    ideal, but it seems sufficiently unlikely that someone will tag something
    #    QQ.
    #  * The tag must be at least four characters in length for the fulltext index
    #    to work, so we pad with _ if necessary.
    #  * The tag must not be numeric, so we prefix with _ if the tag is a number.
    #
    # example:
    #   ['blue fish', 'tv',   '12',   '1234',  'cafÃ©'] =>
    #   ['blue_fish', '__tv', '__12', '_1234', 'cafQQC3QQA9']
    #
    def searchable_tag_list(tags)
      tags.map do |s|
        s = s.gsub(/[\s\.\+]/, '_') # characters that should be skipped by CGI.escape
        s = CGI.escape(s)
        s = s.gsub('%', 'QQ')
        format('%4s', s).gsub(/\s|^(\d)/, '_\1')
      end
