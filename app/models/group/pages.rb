  # Almost every page is retrieved from the database using this method.
  # (1) first, we attempt to load the page using the page owner directly.
  # (2) if that fails, then we resort to searching the entire
  #     namespace of the group
  #
  # Suppose two groups share a page. Only one can be the owner.
  #
  # When linking to the page from the owner's home, we just
  # do /owner-name/page-name. No problem, everyone is happy.
  #
  # But what link do we use for the non-owner's home? /non-owner-name/page-name.
  # This makes it so the banner will belong to the non-owner and it will not
  # be jarring click on a link from the non-owner's home and get teleported to
  # some other group.
  #
  # In order to make this work, we need the second query that includes all the
  # group participation objects.
  #
  # It is true that we could just do without the first query. It makes it slower
  # when the owner is not the context. However, this first query is much faster
  # and is likely to be used much more often than the second query.
