#
# Picture -- a simple record to hold a single image file.
#
# We have three models that handle image files: Asset, Avatar, and
# Picture. Why so many? They are each pretty different.
#
#   Asset   -- for when you need versioning and thumbnails
#              of any content type.
#              Permissions: YES
#
#   Avatar  -- for square icons of users and groups.
#              Permissions: NO
#
#   Picture -- when you want a simple image and want to be able to
#              display it with many sizing options.
#              Permissions: maybe eventually.
#
# STORAGE
#
# Picture.dimensions stores, in a hash, the height and width of all
# the resized copies of the image, keyed on the geometry constraints
# that produced the resized copy.
#
# For example:
#
#  { [a,b,c,d] => [width, height],
#    [a,b,c,d] => [width, height] }
#
# where a,b,c,d is the value of:
#
#  min_width, max_width, min_height, max_height
#
# Suppose picture.dimensions looks like this:
#
#  {'full' => [256,256], [100,100,0,400] => [100,400]}
#
# This corresponds to files stored like so:
#
#  0000/0004/full.jpg
#  0000/0004/100-100-0-400.jpg
#
# The values are integers, and not strings.
#
